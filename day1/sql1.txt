Database 
It is a collection of structured or unstructured data in a format that can be easily accessed digitally and controlled by a dbms
DBMS (Database Management System)
A DBMS is a software used to create, manage, and operate databases by providing tools for data storage, retrieval, and security.

Types of databases
1)  Relational databases:- it is a database where the data is stored in tables in a structured format
     Ex:- mysql , postgresql, oracle database
2) Non-relational databases:- it is a database where the data is stored in unstructured way
 such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs, or wide-column stores.
     Ex:- mongodb, no sql, neo4

Relational Database: A collection of related tables.
Table:  collection of rows and columns (like an Excel sheet).
Column (Field):  collection of field names
A single attribute of the table.
Example: id, name, branch, age
Row (Record):collection of field values
 One complete set of related data.
Example (student): 1, "Amit", "CS", 20

Database can be deployed in two way
On premises—deployed in the server which is managed by client
On  cloud--- deployed in the server where data is managed by cloud service providers

Sql 
Sql is statically typed programming language used to interact with relational database
Used to query and retrieve data from the  database
  => SQL stands for structured query language.
  => it is a language used to communicate with the mysql.
  => user communicates with mysql by sending commands called queries.
  => a query is a command/request/question submitted to mysql
       to perform some operation over db.

        1 DDL (Data Definition Lang)
        2 DML (Data Manipulation Lang)
        3 DQL (Data Query Lang)
        4 DCL (Data Control Lang)
        5 TCL  (Transaction Control Lang)
